Weaving/Tablet version 0.8
==========================

Weaving::Tablet provides an object-oriented tablet weaving simulation
for four-holed tablets with quarter turns and idling tablets. This is
intended to be the computational guts of a GUI for designing patterns.
A Tk user interface is provided as Weaving::Tablet::Tk.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   
For the truly lazy (like me), the test script for the Tk interface
starts it up. Thus, 'make test' suffices to use the design tool.

Note also a number of pattern files in the Tk directory. You get my
miscellaneous cruft along with the code.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Tk for the Tk user interface
