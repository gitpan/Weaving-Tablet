SYNOPSIS
      use Snartemo::Tk;
      use Tk;
      my $pattern = Snartemo::Tk->new_pattern(mw => $mw, file => $file);
      my $pattern2 = Snartemo::Tk->new_pattern(mw => $mw, cards => $cards, rows => $rows);

DESCRIPTION
    Snartemo::Tk wraps a Tk user interface around the core routines in
    Snartemo.

    Snartemo::Tk is a subclass of Snartemo.

  new

    The new function expects arguments as key/value pairs.

    The key "mw" is always expected. If not present, a new MainWindow is
    created. If present, it is the parent for a new Toplevel window.

    The key "file" identifies a pattern file to be loaded. If a pattern
    cannot be loaded from that file, undef is returned.

    The keys "cards" and "rows" specify the size of a new, blank pattern.

    If the "file" key is not provided, a blank pattern is created, with a
    default size of 1 row by 1 card.

    The window and the drawing canvas are available via member functions.

  Member Functions

    You can retrieve the Toplevel window via the "window" member. You can
    retrieve the drawing canvas via the "canvas" member.
